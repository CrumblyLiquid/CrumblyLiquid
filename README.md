## Hi, I'm CrumblyLiquid! :dolphin:

I'm currently doing ground breaking research on the properties of accelerated discrete endofunctors
while pursuing a career in monoid oriented programming. My schedule is pretty busy
as having to travel through non-euclidian space is pretty time consuming.
I'm probably going to have to invent a new form of Pascalian algebra to solve
this fundamentally unordered traveling salesman problem once and for all.

## Interests :telescope:

- Finnish machine supervisory program (Linux) :computer:
- Highly extensible modal code and text authoring solution (Neovim) :pencil:
- Enterprise-grade type-safe zero-cost software developement platform (Rust) :rocket:
- Next-generation computational syntax architecture (Language design) :alien:

## Currently Learning :book:

- How to exit Vim :fire:
